These are the files needed for the vulnerable web server on the Vulnerable Sandbox.

If you need to get the website working, here are the instructions:
    1. Download and install XAMPP. Install the Apache and MySQL packages (you can install others but these are the only two needed for the site.)
    2. Go into XAMPP files, and then the "htdocs" folder, and paste this entire directory into that folder
    3. Then start the Apache and MySQL servers
    4. Go to localhost/dvwa-master (or whatever this folder is called) and follow the instructions! (if it's your first time setting up the website, click the button on the bottom left.)
