# README
This repository includes all files you'll need to run a basic two player Bomberman on any website. Just clone and move the files to your webpage folder! Currently a work in progress.

## In progress:
### Adding power-ups
\+ Power-ups can currently be picked up, and will changed the players attributes.

\+ Power-ups will disappear when exploded.

\- Power-ups do not drop naturally yet.

### Death upon explosion
\+ Players will die when exploded, and the game will end, announcing a winner.

\- End winning screen is a plain alert, which occurs before the explosion is rendered, and overall feels bad.

\- Power-ups will not disappear when exploded yet.
