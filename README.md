# bomberman-website
This repository includes all files you'll need to run a basic two player Bomberman on any website. Just clone and move the files to your public_html folder! Currently a work in progress.
The basic bomberman game was forked from https://gist.github.com/straker/769fb461e066147ea16ac2cb9463beae. A big thanks to them for sharing that!
